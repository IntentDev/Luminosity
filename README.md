### Prerequisites

TouchDesigner099 Official Build 2018.16620 or newer

Note: There is a bug in the new experimental Touchdesigner builds where the list COMP is not cooking when it has parameters that have dependencies (expressions) that change. Various radio buttons that have a dynamic number of buttons are not updating. It is recommended to use the official Touchdesigner build at this time.
