- test all plugins

- go through each synth, scene and effect and disable morphing on appropriate parameters (mostly dropdowns, ints and buttons)

- get talkback from nodes cleaner (ie should load a .tox so ports aren't taken)

- strobe needs option to use 2 Color Ramp Primary Color

- rename 2 Color Ramps colors to Primary and Secondary

non-essential:

- stutter effect and feedback delay need to updated to accomodate non 60 fps framerates.

- 2 color ramp's blend position should be offset so it is centered when ColorSplitPosition is set to .5 also when step is 1 it should still be centered (which it is now)

- add legato mode cue so clip doesn't trigger at start

- update Scene Clip plugin:
	- scenes need trigger function
	- scenes need a way to inform Scene Clip of presets
	
	
- clean up clipChannels stop/delayStop scripts (remove stop arg use channel.name)

- update video convertor to create table based clip attributes (no CLIP_DATABASE)

- use attr numOutputs for multiClip Trig

- bring Fire2d Synth back and / or Fluid Particles


- select channel selects currently selected clip controls

- remove map primary/secondary from outputs

- enable/disable parameters function in parms(show/hide)

-add height uiAttr for gadgets

-transform on channelMix

-fix up mod routing (select channels instead of CHOP)

-make eq effect!

- Controller Mapping updates:
	- create UI and system for editing mapped gadgets (ie ranges)
